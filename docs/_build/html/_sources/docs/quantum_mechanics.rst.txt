Quantum Mechanics
=================

To begin with, we will avoid philosophical debates about "quantum weirdness" in the document.  Whether or not the observations make sense based on our common-sense intuition is a separate topic.  The starting point for the approach in this work is to take the theory and resulting predictions, and compare them to experimental results to determine validity.

The other aspect will be to delve into various topics as deeply as necessary to extract the crucial elements.  This exploration may not be uniform in all cases.  In some aspects, deep-dives may be required or desired, and in others basic results or perhaps intermediate level results will be explored to assure reasonable understanding.
