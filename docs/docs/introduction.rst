Introduction
============

Quantum Computing (QC) is a fascinating subject which combines many different fields towards some interesting end-goals.  In particular, it combines quantum mechanics (quantum field theory), computer science, hardware, towards practical solutions in science, technology, and industry.

This document is supposed to journal the on-going exploration by the author to understand the field, apply some of the knowledge to certain example cases, explore and potentially extend some results.  The idea is to be able to implement some actual code and test out ideas on simulations where possible, and develop theoretical results, both from first principles, as well as computationally derived.
