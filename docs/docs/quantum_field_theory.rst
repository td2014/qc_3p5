Quantum Field Theory
====================

Quantum Field Theory can be summarized as the "Theory of Everything" in that the end result is what is called "The Standard Model" which represents all the known particles and interactions in the visible universe (not including dark matter and energy).  These quantum fields give rise to interactions between particles as well as the particles themselves.  The fields permeate all time and space.  One important component of QFT is quantum electro-dynamics which relates the interation of photons (radio signals) with other quantum systems (like electrons).  Question:  Does Quantum Electrodynamics govern the interaction of photons with magnetic flux quanta as in the superconducting quantum circuits?
