Advanced Quantum Theory
=======================

It worthwhile going slightly beyond the quantum field discussion and adding something about
quantum gravity, which has recently been shown to have a direct relationship to particular quantum fields.
In fact, there is also a close connection to graph theory and some of obtained results in this setting.
