Advanced Quantum Theory
=======================

It worthwhile going slightly beyond the quantum field discussion and adding something about
quantum gravity, which has recently been shown to have a direct relationship to particular quantum fields.
In fact, there is also a close connection to graph theory and some of obtained results in this setting.

The discussion here will describe some of the connections that have been pointed out by
J. Maldacena and others in this regard:(ref https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykmkvzTu9uo), but briefly
it has been shown that some quantum field computations have "dual" representations based on
an equivalence with gravity and perhaps this leads to different ways of solving a problem.

One of the key aspects of this is the identification of the partition function from statistical mechanics,
and a related function from gravity theory, as a concrete example.  The partition function is very similar
to the "softmax" function used in optimization or machine learning as a point of reference.
